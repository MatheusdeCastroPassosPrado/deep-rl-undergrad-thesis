abstract="RoboCup is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. The first RoboCup competition was held at IJCAI-97, Nagoya. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensorfusion. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. Although RoboCup's final target is a world cup with real robots, RoboCup offers a software platform for research on the software aspects of RoboCup. This paper describes technical challenges involved in RoboCup, rules, and simulation environment.",

     The UT Austin Villa team, from the University of Texas at Austin, won the 
2017 RoboCup 3D Simulation League, winning all 23 games that the team played.  
During the course of the competition the team scored 171 goals without 
conceding any.  Additionally the team won the RoboCup 3D Simulation League 
technical challenge by winning each of a series of three league challenges: 
free, passing and scoring, and Gazebo running challenge. This paper describes 
the changes and improvements made to the team between 2016 and 2017 that 
allowed it to win both the main competition and each of the league technical 
challenges.

pages="45--57",
abstract="We investigate the learning of a flexible humanoid robot kick controller, i.e., the controller should be applicable for multiple contexts, such as different kick distances, initial robot position with respect to the ball or both. Current approaches typically tune or optimise the parameters of the biped kick controller for a single context, such as a kick with longest distance or a kick with a specific distance. Hence our research question is that, how can we obtain a flexible kick controller that controls the robot (near) optimally for a continuous range of kick distances? The goal is to find a parametric function that given a desired kick distance, outputs the (near) optimal controller parameters. We achieve the desired flexibility of the controller by applying a contextual policy search method. With such a contextual policy search algorithm, we can generalize the robot kick controller for different distances, where the desired distance is described by a real-valued vector. We will also show that the optimal parameters of the kick controller is a non-linear function of the desired distances and a linear function will fail to properly generalize the kick controller over desired kick distances.",

Under the control of a mini-computer as the artificial brain and on the basis of external informations received from the visual, auditory and dermal senses, etc., the WABOT-1 performs a given work in linked motions of hands and feet in on-line real time.",

To make challenging locomotion tasks tractable, we describe several novel applications of convex, mixed-integer, and sparse nonlinear optimization to problems ranging from footstep placement to whole-body planning and control. We also present a state estimator formulation that, when combined with our walking controller, permits highly precise execution of extended walking plans over non-flat terrain. We describe our complete system integration and experiments carried out on Atlas, a full-size hydraulic humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, Inc.",

abstract="Mathematical programs (MPs) are a class of constrained optimization problems that include linear, mixed-integer, and disjunctive programs. Strategies for solving MPs rely heavily on various transformations between these subclasses, but most are not automated because MP theory does not presently treat programs as syntactic objects. In this work, we present the first syntactic definition of MP and of some widely used MP transformations, most notably the big-M and convex hull methods for converting disjunctive constraints. We use an embedded OCaml DSL on problems from chemical process engineering and operations research to compare our automated transformations to existing technology---finding that no one technique is always best---and also to manual reformulations---finding that our mechanizations are comparable to human experts. This work enables higher-level solution strategies that can use these transformations as subroutines.",

abstract="This chapter proposes an original Model Predictive Control approach to the walking control for humanoid robots, which allows to generate stable walking motions without the prior definition of footsteps positions and instants. Both the instant and amplitude of the changes in the supporting surface are part of the walking motion generation problem, and are described by a set of highly-constrained integer and real variables. Combined with the center of mass trajectory of the robot, this description leads to the formulation of a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program in a Model Predictive Control framework aiming at reaching high-level objectives, such as velocity tracking and tip-over risk minimization. The contribution of this approach is illustrated by the simulation of two scenarii, demonstrating the validity of the steps and trajectories computed in push-recovery and walking velocity tracking cases.",

  abstract={
   This paper presents the design and learning architecture for an 
omnidirectional walk used by a humanoid robot soccer agent acting in the RoboCup
3D simulation environment.  The walk, which was originally designed for and 
tested on an actual Nao robot before being employed in the 2011 RoboCup 3D
simulation competition, was the crucial component in the UT Austin Villa team
winning the competition in 2011.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first time that robot behavior has been conceived and constructed on a real 
robot for the end purpose of being used in simulation.  The walk is based on a 
double linear inverted pendulum model, and multiple sets of its parameters are
optimized via a novel framework. The framework optimizes parameters for 
different tasks in conjunction with one another, a little-understood problem 
with substantial practical significance.  Detailed experiments show that the UT 
Austin Villa agent significantly outperforms all the other agents in the 
competition with the optimized walk being the key to its success.

	title="On Optimizing Interdependent Skills: A Case Study in Simulated 3D Humanoid Robot Soccer",
	booktitle="Proc. of 10th Int. Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS)",
	month="May",
	year="2011",
	abstract={ In several realistic domains an agent's behavior
	is composed of multiple \textit{interdependent} skills. For example, 
	consider a humanoid robot that must play soccer, as is the focus of this
	paper. In order to succeed, it is clear that the robot needs to walk
	quickly, turn sharply, and kick the ball far. However, these
	individual skills are ineffective if the robot falls down when
	switching from walking to turning, or if it cannot position itself
	behind the ball for a kick.
	This paper presents a learning architecture for a humanoid robot
	soccer agent that has been fully deployed and tested within the
	RoboCup 3D simulation environment. First, we demonstrate that
	individual skills such as walking and turning can be parameterized and
	optimized to match the best performance statistics reported in the
	literature.  These results are achieved through effective use of the
	CMA-ES optimization algorithm. Next, we describe a framework for
	optimizing skills \textit{in conjunction} with one another, a
	little-understood problem with substantial practical
	significance. Over several phases of learning, a total of roughly 100--150
	parameters are optimized. Detailed experiments show that an agent thus
	optimized performs comparably with the top teams from the RoboCup 2010
	competitions, while taking relatively few man-hours for development. },
